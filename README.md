# country_search_dropdown

A vanilla php, jquery, ajax, bootstrap 5 searchable dropdown, returns the country names in the browser language.

Uses the $brolang variable to determine language. The search is performed in the language of the user. So a search by a Spanish user will turn up "None Found" if the search term is entered in English. We included the function we use to determine the user language, but you can just use the HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE variable to read your user's browser language.

This code is frame independent. You're welcome to fork and convert it to your preferred framework.

I am storing the MYSQL tables' sql scripts as well as all the code required to make it work.

We cannot promise quality support so please be aware that you need to know PHP, JQUERY, MYSQL, CSS and AJAX at a minimum level in order to use this software.
